# Design-of-River-waste-water-collector
# Abstract
This project emphasis on design of the river waste collection. Trillions of pieces of plastic currently pollute the seas, rivers, lakes, ocean harming sea life, contaminating ecosystems and making a mess on beaches. Thus It's important to clean up the plastic in the water, but nobody knows how best to do so yet. These days practically all the assembling procedure is being automized so as to convey the items at a quicker rate. Automation plays an important role in mass production. In this venture we have manufactured the remote worked waterway cleaning machine. Prime objective of our project is to collect all the wastes which are found floating on water bodies and to minimize labor work. These are done by using a hardware prototype and by using an Microcontroller for controlling all parts of a machine by using an smart phone by using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. We have attempted to meet every one of the destinations to this item fruitful with the end goal that our item gets propelled in the market.
# Introduction
The "Stream Waste authority machine" utilized in that places where there is squander flotsam and jetsam in the water body which are to be expelled. This machine is consists of waterwheel driven conveyer mechanism which collect & remove the wastage, garbage & plastic wastages from water bodies.
This additionally lessen the challenges which we face when gathering of flotsam and jetsam happen. A machine will lift the waste surface flotsam and jetsam from the water bodies, this will eventually result in decrease of water contamination and in conclusion the sea-going creature's demise to these issues will water. The use of this project will be made in rivers, ponds and other water bodies to clean the surface water debris from bodies.
